During the employment as an apprentice and student assistant, as well as during the engagement in student-run organizations, I was able to get experience in full-stack software development, and especially the development of web applications (back- and frontend). I see myself as a software developer and engineer. Currently, my GitHub profile contains a single project, consisting of dockerized backend and frontend templates for a quick setup of a web application package with Spring Boot and React.",

    "summary": "I joined the local student-run organization AIESEC in Aachen during my master's. Starting as a member in the marketing department, I was responsible for all local marketing activities, ranging from the planning and execution of info events, lecture presentations and the cooperation with partner initiatives and institutions. After half a year, I joined the national information systems team (NIST) of AIESEC in Germany. As a community engager in the NIST, I was responsible for the first-level support for all our technical systems, as well as providing the community with educational material for being able to work with the systems. In April 2017, I participated in a volunteering project in Recife (Brazil) called 'Global Volunteer' organized by AIESEC, supported with a scholarship by Microsoft. For two months, I worked in the community library 'Biblioteca Comunitária Caranguejo Tabaiares' within a favela. My main engagement was to plan and execute activities for children at the age of five to twelve years, which helped them to develop an awareness for cultural diversity. Furthermore, I took part in a trainer seminar in August 2017, which enabled me to act as a trainer within the organization. Up to now, I was able to train several intercultural, functional and team building workshops and seminars. Another opportunity was the organization of a national conference for 300 participants in January 2018. In the position of the organizing committee president, I was leading a team of 10 team members, coordinating finances, logistics and fundraising.",
